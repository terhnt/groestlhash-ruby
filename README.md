WIP: Attempt to convert js groestl to ruby

This is an attempt by a ruby noob ( been messing with ruby for 3 days as of this edit ), I need groestl512 for a project i am working on and this appeared to be my only way to be able to use it in ruby.

Any help with fixing this would be appreciated, though i will be actively trying to squash whatever bugs, and hopefully i haven't broken the code along the way.
